# How to Vibe Code: Structured AI Development Methodology

> **A structured approach to AI-assisted development that prioritizes planning over coding**

## 🎯 What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe coding is **NOT** chaotic, uncontrolled AI development. It's a **structured, repeatable process** that shifts time allocation from coding to planning:

- **Knowledge Document Templates** - Prevent context overflow and ensure architectural consistency
- **AI Agent Orchestration** - Cursor (backend), Replit (frontend), ChatGPT (planning)
- **Structural Integrity** - Maintain project structure for agent coordination
- **Iterative Planning** - 2-3 days planning, 1-2 days implementation

## 🚀 The Core Insight

- **Planning Time**: 2-3 days iterating on knowledge documents
- **Implementation Time**: 1-2 days for actual coding and deployment
- **Cost Reality**: ~$1/week (99¢ pizza slice equivalent) - why aren't you already doing this?
- **Focus**: Product engineering over actual coding

## 📚 Knowledge Document Framework

This repository provides a **6-document template system** that transforms vague ideas into structured, AI-agent-ready specifications:

### 1. **FOUNDATION_KNOWLEDGE** 
Project constitution and development philosophy
- Build philosophy and core values
- AI agent roles and division of labor
- Development rules and constraints
- What we're NOT doing (scope control)

### 2. **SCOPE_DOC**
Detailed project scope and development roadmap
- One-line summary and core purpose
- What we're building vs. what we're NOT building
- External dependencies and performance requirements
- 3-phase development roadmap

### 3. **STRUCTURE_MAP**
Technical architecture and file organization
- Directory layout and layer responsibilities
- API integration rules and patterns
- Cursor/Replit constraints and boundaries
- Frontend integration entry points

### 4. **REALITY_TESTS**
Testing strategy and quality assurance framework
- Sample data payloads and critical user flows
- Edge cases and performance test scenarios
- Expected behavior on failure
- Quality assurance requirements

### 5. **AGENT_PROMPT_MAP**
AI agent communication and task delegation
- ChatGPT prompt templates for project scoping
- Cursor prompts for backend development
- Replit prompts for frontend components
- Integration prompts for cross-component tasks

### 6. **AGENTIC_LOGIC_GUIDE**
Intelligent system design patterns and best practices
- Context management and decision making
- External service integration patterns
- Testing intelligent logic strategies
- Implementation guidelines and common patterns

## 🎯 Example: Auto-Graph Project

This repository includes a **complete example** of the vibe coding methodology applied to build **Auto-Graph** - an agent-aware hierarchical codebase graph generator.

### What Auto-Graph Does
- Analyzes any codebase and generates HLD/LLD architectural graphs
- Detects AI agent usage patterns for enterprise compliance
- Provides interactive web visualization with multi-format export
- Built for enterprise teams using AI agents

### Project Structure

```

### Key Achievements
- **59 nodes, 1288 edges** generated from sample calculator app
- **6 export formats** (JSON, YAML, CSV, DOT, HTML, Mermaid)
- **Real-time web interface** with drag-and-drop file upload
- **Agent detection** with risk assessment and compliance reporting
- **<30 seconds** processing time for typical codebases
- **<500MB** memory usage for standard analysis
