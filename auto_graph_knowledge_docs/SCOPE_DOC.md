# SCOPE_DOC

## One-line Summary
Web-based codebase analysis tool that generates hierarchical architectural graphs with AI agent detection for teams using AI agents.

## What We're Building
- **Functionality Overview:** Codebase analysis platform that parses files, detects AI components, and generates hierarchical graphs
- **Input Behavior:** Accepts codebase uploads (ZIP files, GitHub URLs) and processes multi-language codebases
- **Output Behavior:** Generates hierarchical graphs (HLD/LLD), detects AI components, and provides multi-format exports
- **Core Logic Description:** AST parsing → LLM semantic analysis → graph construction → agent detection → export generation
- **Intelligent Processing:** AI component detection, semantic analysis, hierarchical graph construction, and multi-format export

## What We're NOT Building
- Real-time collaborative code editing or live analysis
- Custom AI model training or advanced machine learning
- Complex user authentication or role-based access control
- Real-time WebSocket communication for live updates
- Advanced database integration or persistent user data storage
- Mobile applications or native mobile interfaces
- Enterprise compliance reporting (SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)

## External Dependencies
- **Primary Services:** OpenAI API for LLM-powered semantic analysis
- **Secondary Services:** File system for codebase access, temporary storage for analysis sessions
- **Rate Limits & Costs:** OpenAI API rate limits, token usage monitoring, cost optimization
- **Fallback Strategies:** Cached responses, offline analysis capabilities, graceful degradation

## Performance Requirements
- **Response Time:** <30 seconds for typical codebases, real-time progress updates
- **Concurrency:** Support multiple simultaneous analysis sessions
- **Resource Usage:** Efficient memory usage for large codebases, optimized LLM API calls
- **Scalability:** Handle codebases with thousands of files

## Single Feature Use Case
- **Real-world Problem:** Developers need to understand complex codebase architecture and identify AI component usage
- **User Story:** As a developer, I want to upload a codebase and get a hierarchical graph showing the architecture, AI components, and relationships so that I can understand the codebase structure and identify AI usage patterns.
