# FOUNDATION_KNOWLEDGE

## Build Philosophy
- Define the core values driving this project (e.g., Simplicity, Robustness, Minimalism, Agentic Intelligence)
- State the primary focus: technical excellence, user experience, business value, or something else
- Specify how to prioritize between speed of development and code quality

## AI Agent Roles & Division of Labor
- **Cursor Role:** Backend logic, route implementation, integration, AI service orchestration
- **Replit Role:** Frontend components (HTML/CSS/JS only), user interface design, visualization
- **ChatGPT Role:** Project scoping, document refinement, prompt creation, AI service optimization

## Development Rules & Constraints
- **Project Structure:** Fixed folder/file naming conventions that must be followed
- **Stack Limitations:** Technologies allowed vs. prohibited (e.g., only HTML/CSS/JS frontend, single-server Python backend)
- **Code Organization:** How different types of logic should be separated
- **Integration Patterns:** How frontend and backend should communicate
- **AI Service Integration:** Centralized management patterns for external AI services
- **Context Management:** State preservation and conversation handling requirements

## Data Realism Principles
- Define what constitutes "realistic" data for this project
- Specify how sample data should be structured to represent real-world scenarios
- State what formats and structures should be used for different data types
- Define how data relationships and dependencies should be modeled
- Include AI service response formats and context state management

## External Service Integration
- **Service Dependencies:** What external services this project will use
- **Integration Patterns:** How external services should be integrated
- **Error Handling:** What happens when external services fail
- **Performance Constraints:** Limits and requirements for external calls
- **Cost Management:** How to handle API usage and rate limiting

## Quality Assurance Guidelines
- **Testing Strategy:** How the project should be tested
- **Error Handling:** What error scenarios must be handled
- **Performance Requirements:** What are the performance expectations
- **User Experience:** What quality standards apply to user interactions
- **AI Service Reliability:** How to ensure AI services work consistently

## What We're NOT Doing
- Features or complexities explicitly avoided
- Architectural decisions being skipped to maintain simplicity
- External dependencies that are too complex or expensive
- Real-time features that require too much complexity
- Development patterns that add unnecessary complexity

## Output Goals
- What must the final system be able to do
- What deployment and testing requirements apply
- What integration capabilities are required
- What performance and reliability standards must be met
- How to maintain simplicity while achieving functionality
