# SCOPE_DOC

## One-line Summary
- Define the core purpose in a single sentence

## What We're Building
- **Functionality Overview:** What is the core purpose and main features
- **Input Behavior:** What types of inputs does the system accept
- **Output Behavior:** What types of outputs does the system produce
- **Core Logic Description:** How does the system process inputs to produce outputs
- **Intelligent Processing:** How does the system make decisions or adapt its behavior

## What We're NOT Building
- What functionalities are explicitly excluded from scope
- What design or UX enhancements are outside the current scope
- What integration features are being postponed
- What external dependencies are too complex for this phase

## External Dependencies
- **Primary Services:** What external services are essential for core functionality
- **Secondary Services:** What optional services enhance the system
- **Rate Limits & Costs:** What are the constraints on external service usage
- **Fallback Strategies:** What happens when external services are unavailable

## Performance Requirements
- **Response Time:** What are the expected latencies for different operations
- **Concurrency:** How many users or requests can be handled simultaneously
- **Resource Usage:** What are the memory, CPU, and storage constraints
- **Scalability:** How should the system handle increased load

## Single Feature Use Case
- **Real-world Problem:** What specific problem does this solve
- **User Story:** As a [user], I want to [do something] so that I can [achieve outcome]
