```

## ðŸ”„ Communication Patterns

### 1. Shared Knowledge Documents
**Purpose**: Ensure all agents work from the same specifications

**Implementation:**
- Keep all knowledge docs in a shared location
- Reference specific sections in prompts
- Update docs as requirements evolve
- Use version control for document changes

**Example:**
```markdown
"Follow the STRUCTURE_MAP in knowledge_docs_templates/STRUCTURE_MAP_template.md:
- Create files in the specified directory structure
- Follow the layer responsibilities defined
- Use the API integration rules provided
- Maintain the Cursor/Replit constraints"
```

### 2. Intermediate JSON Outputs
**Purpose**: Enable data exchange between agents

**Implementation:**
- Define JSON schemas for data exchange
- Use consistent data formats across agents
- Validate data structure before processing
- Document all data formats and schemas

**Example Schema:**
```json
{
  "analysis_result": {
    "status": "completed",
    "nodes": [
      {
        "id": "module_api",
        "name": "API Layer",
        "type": "Module",
        "level": "HLD",
        "files": ["api/routes/user.js"],
        "metadata": {
          "purpose": "Handles HTTP requests",
          "complexity": "medium",
          "agent_touched": false
        }
      }
    ],
    "edges": [
      {
        "from": "module_api",
        "to": "component_userController",
        "type": "contains"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3. Prompt Templates
**Purpose**: Ensure consistent communication quality

**Implementation:**
- Create reusable prompt templates
- Customize templates for specific tasks
- Maintain prompt version control
- Optimize prompts based on results

**Template Structure:**
```markdown
## Task Description
[Clear description of what needs to be built]

## Requirements
- [Specific requirement 1]
- [Specific requirement 2]
- [Specific requirement 3]

## Constraints
- [Technical constraint 1]
- [Technical constraint 2]
- [Business constraint 1]

## Expected Output
- [Expected file structure]
